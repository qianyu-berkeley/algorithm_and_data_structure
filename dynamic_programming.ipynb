    "# Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to think about dynamic programming, \"DP\", is nothing more than as an approach to optimize an algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Find an algorithm that \"brute forces\" a problem\n",
    "2.  Notice that it fits into the the class of algorithms DP can optimize\n",
    "3.  Implement algorithm using DP\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming does **not** have anything to do with on-the-fly code generation, online reinforcement learning, editing/optimizing compiled code while it's running... or anything else fancy.  So what does it do?  Read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does DP work?\n",
    "\n",
    "It boils down to a simple idea:  _don't let your code do the same work twice_.  In practice, this means that you should cache intermediate results (say, in a table).  Each time you need to evaluate a function with the same input after the first, you can look up the result in the cache rather than recomputing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will sometimes hear DP is used for problems whose solutions are combinations of the solutions to \"optimal subproblems\".  Unpacking this a little bit:  if each solution is just a combination of smaller versions of the same problem, and you cache the results of the smaller problems as you go, to the extent that you need those solutions in more than one place, you'll get a speed up.  For many problems, an exponential time naive implementation can be made to run in polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't let this sound complicated to you.**  All we're doing is adding a cache to avoid recomputing an \"expensive\" function.  Any time you see a problem that sounds like, \"Try every possible combination of X and pick the best\", you should think \"I wonder if there are any partial results here we can cache and reuse\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is this important for natural language processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the course contains a wide variety of algorithms that run passibly fast only when we apply a judicious amount of dynamic programing. Notably, both sequence tagging tasks (like part-of-speech tagging and entity recognition) and structured-prediction tasks like parsing will make heavy use of DP!"

    "## Example: Climbing the stairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to compute the total number of ways you can run up a flight of stairs.  At each step, $k$, you can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a regular step up to $k + 1$\n",
    "- Take a big step up to $k + 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting on stair $0$ (the bottom floor), how many unique ways are there to get up a staircase with $n$ stairs?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've not encountered this kind of problem before, **spend a minute pondering** how you might compute this.  It's common to feel \"lost\" in the combinatorial explosion of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Could you figure out the number of ways up a staircase of height $n$ if you were told how many ways you might get up staircases of height $n - 1$ and $n - 2$?  That is, if you knew the solution to a _subproblem_, could you use that to compute the solution to your real problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you can get to the second-to-the-top stair in 8 ways (and then take a big step) and the next-to-the-top stair in 13 ways (and then take a small step).  How many ways to the top?  8 + 13 = 21.  (Note that you don't have to count \"get to second-to-the-top and take two regular steps\" separately because the \"13\" ways to get to the next-to-the-top stair already includes them.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if there are $ways(n - 1)$ to get to the $n - 1$ stair, you can use any of those methods to get there and then take a regular step to get to stair $n$.  Similarly, if you have $ways(n - 2)$ to get to the $n - 2$ step and then take a big step to stair $n$.  There is no other way to get to stair $n$ except by one of those two sets of options.  There is no overlap between those sets of sequences as sequences in the first set always end in a \"regular\" step and those sequences in the second set always end in a \"big\" step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In math, $ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice (imagine, or draw a picture), $ways(1) = 1$ and $ways(2) = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Aside: you may recognize this as the famous [Fibbonaci series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).*\n",
